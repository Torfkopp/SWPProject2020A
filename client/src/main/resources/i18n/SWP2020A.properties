rules.bank.text.devcards=You can also give the Bank 1 Ore, 1 Wool, and 1 Grain and receive a random Development Card from it in \
  exchange. They might just push you ahead of the others, so don't forget to check them.
rules.bank.text.devcards.description=The Button to buy a Development Card will only be available if you have enough Resources to \
  afford it, so make sure to use it when you see it.
rules.bank.text.ratio.any=Harbours labeled "Any" will provide for a 3:1 exchange rate on any Resources.
rules.bank.text.ratio.specific=Harbours labeled with a Resource name will provide for a 2:1 exchange rate, but only for exchanges \
  with the Resource on the harbour. So a "Grain" harbour will let you exchange 2 Grain for 1 other Resource but not 2 Bricks for \
  something else (unless you have a "Brick" harbour of course).
rules.bank.text.ratios=Normally, the Bank operates with a 4:1 exchange rate (meaning it will accept 4 Resources of yours and \
  grant you 1 Resource of your choice in exchange).\n\nThis exchange rate can be adjusted, however. Simply reach one of the \
  harbours at the coast of Catan and place a settlement there.
rules.bank.text.title=Have some excess Resources but urgently need a very specific one? Don't worry, the Bank has your back!\
  \n\nGlad to help with any Settler's Resource needs, the Bank offers to exchange one type of Resources for \
  another. It also sells Development Cards, but they're randomised, so who knows what you might get?
rules.basics.text.intro=By building roads, settlements, and even entire cities, you will make your mark on history. \
  But you are not alone on this island. Plan, build, and trade your way to glorious victory and become the master of Catan!
rules.basics.text.title=It is time to settle the Island of Catan!\n\nYou have been tasked with settling this island, so let's get to work!
rules.building.text.description=The circle represents a settlement, and the long rectangle a road. Cities are displayed as squares.\n\
  All roads must be placed on the edge between two hexagons and all settlements have to be placed on an intersection where three \
  hexagons meet.
rules.building.text.indicators=The transparent grey areas show you where building is currently possible. Use this to plan ahead.\n\
  You can only build a road next to another road or a settlement or city.\nSettlements can only be placed adjacent to a road.\nCities are only \
  available as an upgrade to a settlement.
rules.building.text.sendoff=Build up a vast network of roads and cities and build your trade empire!
rules.building.text.title=After rolling the dice to determine what resources you collect this turn, you can build settlements, \
  roads, and eventually even cities!

rules.devcards.text.title=No Settler's equipment is complete without their trusted Development Cards!\nDevelopment Cards are essential \
  to building your trade empire and are being provided to you by the Bank in exchange for 1 Ore, 1 Wool and 1 Grain.\n\n\
  There are 5 types of Development Card:
rules.devcards.text.unique.intro=There are two unique Development Cards that track the progress of the very top of Settlers:\n\n\
  - Largest Army\n\ \ \ This card tells everyone which Settler has the largest number of Knights. A mighty adversary!\n\n\
  - Longest Road\n\ \ \ This card tells everyone which Settler has the longest continuous road system. Someone to watch out for!
rules.devcards.text.vpc.description=\ \ \ This card instantly and permanently increases your Victory Points by one.
rules.devcards.text.vpc.name=- Victory Point Cards
rules.devcards.text.yopc.description=\ \ \ When played, this card will grant you any two Resources you like (e.g. 1 Brick and 1 Ore).
rules.devcards.text.yopc.name=- Year Of Plenty Cards
rules.founding.text.concept=To make a beginning at all possible, each Settler gets to place down 2 Settlements and 2 Roads at no \
  Resource cost to them. There is a specific order in which the building takes places:
rules.founding.text.order=The first player has to place down a settlement on any free intersection of three hexagons and then \
  one road directly next to the settlement. Then, it will be the second player's turn to do the same, all the way until the \
  last player has placed down their first settlement and road. Here, the order will be reversed.\n\nOnce the last player confirms \
  their build, they now get to start with the placement of the second free settlement with a road. After them, it's the second to last \
  player's turn, and so on until the first player gets to place down the second settlement and road. Once they also confirm their \
  building, the "Roll Dice" button will be enabled and the real game kicks off as normally.
rules.founding.text.order.short=In short, the turn order is altered to (with 4 Players):\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 > 1 starts the real game by rolling dice\
  \n\nWith 3 Players, it'll be:\n1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 > 1 starts the real game by rolling dice
rules.founding.text.startresources=Each player will get Resources for placing down their second settlement. What they receive \
  depends on the resource tiles around the second settlement.
rules.founding.text.title=For the experienced Settlers: Start from the very beginning, with nothing to your name and freedom \
  to decide where your empire will have its roots!
rules.robber.text.intro=When someone rolls a 7 with the dice, the Robbers come out of hiding and steal half of all your Resources. \
  Thankfully, you get to decided which ones specifically. Also, out of courtesy for poor Settlers, they will only take their "tax" \
  from anyone who has more than 7 Resources.\n\nThe Robbers will also steal any Resources produced by the hexagon they are hiding on, so you \
  won't gain any Resources off that tile until the Robbers are moved elsewhere.
rules.robber.text.symboldescriptor=The Robber is represented by the large black triangle. When being told to move the Robber, click \
  on the center of the hexagon you wish to move it to. (Maybe next to a rival's city?)
rules.robber.text.tax=You get to pick which Resources you will lose by using the sliders on the left.
rules.robber.text.title=An enemy lurks in the desert sands of Catan... A rag-tag band of Robbers is out to take their cut from your proceeds!

  you would like to receive from the other person.\nImportant: The numbers on the other person's sliders only tell you how many \
  Resources they have in total, not how many of any individual Resource. So you might just be making an impossible offer...
rules.trading.text.howto.4=4) Wait for the other player's response. They might accept, in which case you will both receive the \
  agreed upon Resources. If they refuse, they have an option to make a counter offer which they consider more reasonable (or possible?) \
  to agree to.
rules.trading.text.howto.5=5) If they refused, you can try again with a new offer. If they sent a counter offer, you can send a counter \
  offer to their counter offer and so on, until either time runs out or you find agreement. Use the chat function if you \
  want to discuss in detail.
rules.trading.text.title=What does every Settler need? Resources! But how to get that last bit of Ore to finally build the city \
  of your dreams when your Ore supply is low but your fellow Settlers are building cities one after the other?\n\nMake them a \
  trade offer they can't refuse!
