rules.bank.text.devcards=you can also give the bank 1 ore, 1 wool, and 1 grain and receive a random development card from it in \
  exchange. they might just push you ahead of the others, so don't forget to check them.
rules.bank.text.devcards.description=the button to buy a development card will only be available if you have enough resources to \
  afford it, so make sure to use it when you see it.
rules.bank.text.ratio.any=harbours labeled "any" will provide for a 3:1 exchange rate on any resources.
rules.bank.text.ratio.specific=harbours labeled with a resource name will provide for a 2:1 exchange rate, but only for exchanges \
  with the resource on the harbour. so a "grain" harbour will let you exchange 2 grain for 1 other resource but not 2 bricks for \
  something else (unless you have a "brick" harbour of course).
rules.bank.text.ratios=normally, the bank operates with a 4:1 exchange rate (meaning it will accept 4 resources of yours and \
  grant you 1 resource of your choice in exchange).\n\nthis exchange rate can be adjusted, however. simply reach one of the \
  harbours at the coast of catan and place a settlement there.
rules.bank.text.title=have some excess resources but urgently need a very specific one. don't worry, the bank has your back.\
  \n\nglad to help with any settler's resource needs, the bank offers to exchange one type of resources for \
  another. it also sells development cards, but they're randomised, so who knows what you might get.
rules.basics.text.intro=by building roads, settlements, and even entire cities, you will make your mark on history. \
  but you are not alone on this island. plan, build, and trade your way to glorious victory and become the master of catan.
rules.basics.text.title=it is time to settle the island of catan.\n\nyou have been tasked with settling this island, so let's get to work.
rules.building.text.description=the circle represents a settlement, and the long rectangle a road. cities are displayed as squares.\n\
  all roads must be placed on the edge between two hexagons and all settlements have to be placed on an intersection where three \
  hexagons meet.
rules.building.text.indicators=the transparent grey areas show you where building is currently possible. use this to plan ahead.\n\
  you can only build a road next to another road or a settlement or city.\nsettlements can only be placed adjacent to a road.\ncities are only \
  available as an upgrade to a settlement.
rules.building.text.sendoff=build up a vast network of roads and cities and build your trade empire.
rules.building.text.title=after rolling the dice to determine what resources you collect this turn, you can build settlements, \
  roads, and eventually even cities.

  to building your trade empire and are being provided to you by the bank in exchange for 1 ore, 1 wool and 1 grain.\n\n\
  there are 5 types of development card:
rules.devcards.text.unique.intro=there are two unique development cards that track the progress of the very top of settlers:\n\n\
  - largest army\nthis card tells everyone which settler has the largest number of knights. a mighty adversary.\n\n\
  - longest road\nthis card tells everyone which settler has the longest continuous road system. someone to watch out for.
rules.devcards.text.vpc.description=this card instantly and permanently increases your victory points by one.
rules.devcards.text.vpc.name=- victory point cards
rules.devcards.text.yopc.description=when played, this card will grant you any two resources you like (e.g. 1 brick and 1 ore).
rules.devcards.text.yopc.name=- year of plenty cards
rules.founding.text.concept=to make a beginning at all possible, each settler gets to place down 2 settlements and 2 roads at no \
  resource cost to them. there is a specific order in which the building takes places:
rules.founding.text.order=the first player has to place down a settlement on any free intersection of three hexagons and then \
  one road directly next to the settlement. then, it will be the second player's turn to do the same, all the way until the \
  last player has placed down their first settlement and road. here, the order will be reversed.\n\nonce the last player confirms \
  their build, they now get to start with the placement of the second free settlement with a road. after them, it's the second to last \
  player's turn, and so on until the first player gets to place down the second settlement and road. once they also confirm their \
  building, the "roll dice" button will be enabled and the real game kicks off as normally.
rules.founding.text.order.short=in short, the turn order is altered to (with 4 players):\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 > 1 starts the real game by rolling dice\
  \n\nwith 3 players, it'll be:\n1 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 > 1 starts the real game by rolling dice
rules.founding.text.startresources=each player will get resources for placing down their second settlement. what they receive \
  depends on the resource tiles around the second settlement.
rules.founding.text.title=for the experienced settlers: start from the very beginning, with nothing to your name and freedom \
  to decide where your empire will have its roots.
rules.robber.text.intro=when someone rolls a 7 with the dice, the robbers come out of hiding and steal half of all your resources. \
  thankfully, you get to decided which ones specifically. also, out of courtesy for poor settlers, they will only take their "tax" \
  from anyone who has more than 7 resources.\n\nthe robbers will also steal any resources produced by the hexagon they are hiding on, so you \
  won't gain any resources off that tile until the robbers are moved elsewhere.
rules.robber.text.symboldescriptor=the robber is represented by the large black triangle. when being told to move the robber, click \
  on the center of the hexagon you wish to move it to. (maybe next to a rival's city.)
rules.robber.text.tax=you get to pick which resources you will lose by using the sliders on the left.
rules.robber.text.title=an enemy lurks in the desert sands of catan... a rag-tag band of robbers is out to take their cut from your proceeds.

  you would like to receive from the other person.\nimportant: the numbers on the other person's sliders only tell you how many \
  resources they have in total, not how many of any individual resource. so you might just be making an impossible offer...
rules.trading.text.howto.4=4) wait for the other player's response. they might accept, in which case you will both receive the \
  agreed upon resources. if they refuse, they have an option to make a counter offer which they consider more reasonable (or possible.) \
  to agree to.
rules.trading.text.howto.5=5) if they refused, you can try again with a new offer. if they sent a counter offer, you can send a counter \
  offer to their counter offer and so on, until either time runs out or you find agreement. use the chat function if you \
  want to discuss in detail.
rules.trading.text.title=what does every settler need. resources. but how to get that last bit of ore to finally build the city \
  of your dreams when your ore supply is low but your fellow settlers are building cities one after the other.\n\nmake them a \
